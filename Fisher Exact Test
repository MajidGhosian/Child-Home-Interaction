Fisherâ€™s Exact Test is a statistical test that is used to analyze contingency tables.
This non-parametric test is suitable to show dependency of parameters on a small sample.
In this project we used Fisher's Exact test to investigates the dependency of level of abstraction and gamification to task completion rate.
For this purpise we categorized different task completion rates into 4 categories:

|**Rate Categories**|Rate 1|Rate 2|Rate 3|Rate 4|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|**Number of failed tasks**|0, 1, 2|3, 4, 5|6, 7, 8|8 <
